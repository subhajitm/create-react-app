# Notes
1. **state** : props are passed and set from outside. state is accessible from inside a component.
2. **props**  and **state**  are CORE concepts of React. Actually, only changes in props  and/ or state  trigger React to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser.
3. **props**  allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.
4. React 16.2 has the feature of having **Aux**, with just enclosing the JSX in the return statement as <> ... <>.
